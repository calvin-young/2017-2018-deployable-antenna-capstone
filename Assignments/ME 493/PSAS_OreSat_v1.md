## Project Objective

Design, test, and manufacture the communication antennas and deployment systems for Oregon's first satellite (OreSat) by June 29th, 2018, to be integrated into Portland State Aerospace Society's (PSAS) main satellite, with help from the Oregon Space Grant Consortium (OSGC) to cover the associated $2000 projected cost.

## Customer/Market Requirements

The project sponsor requires two separate deployable sattelite systems. They must communicate with ground control and handheld receivers, deploy reliably, be able with  withstand harsh environments, meet regulatory requirements for cubesats, and fall under budget limitations including weight, cost and power. The Turnstile antenna will deploy first and communicate omnidirectionaly with the ground station for satelite communications and control. The helical antenna will be mounted on the opposite plane of the cubesat and will commuincate with a high gain directional signal to broadcast high definition video from the cameras on the satellite. 

## Design Challenges

The design team is focused on building lightweight deployable antenna systems that will be able to stow as compactly as possible, deploy reliably and communicate at the radio frequencies required by our customer for satellite operations. 

## Outcomes

The turnstile array went through several iterations of 3D printed prototypes in order to evaluate antenna stowage and deployment mechanism performance; selection has been narrowed to two concepts for the next phase of testing, however additional functionality of the antenna requested by the customer requires additional refinement.

The helical antenna will take advantage of spring properties, allowing for stowage under elastic deformation, and deployment without an additional apparatus. In order to achieve a 16 dB output gain, a primary design constraint, the antenna geometry was optimized using MATLAB simulations. Helical springs are being manufactured by a local spring manufacturer and will be assembled and tested.
